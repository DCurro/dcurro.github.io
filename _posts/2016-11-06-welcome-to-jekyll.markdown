The classification of digits in-the-wild is a nigh solved Computer Vision problem even with the wide variety of the shapes and forms that digits can take. In this paper we attempt to obtain similar results to the state-of-the-art using a very well known and very simple Convolutional Neural Network architecture, to classify and further, to detect, house numbers from street level photos provided by the Street View House Number (SVHN) dataset. We also introduce an 11th class to the SVHN data set: background, to aid in the problem of detection.
