Being able to detect road for safe navigation in autonomous cars is an impor- tant problem in computer vision. Road scene segmentation is often applied in autonomous driving and pedestrian detection [7]. In this project, we apply deep learning techniques to train a convolutional neural network to segment road from non-road in images. We will be using the LeNet network as our model of choice[6], as defined in Caffeâ€™s example MNIST Challenge solution.
